    <h2 class="texttitle">Scrum Roles</h2>
    <p class="paragrafo">
        The Scrum Framework defines three roles:
    </br>
    </br>
        1. Product owner Holds the vision for the product
    </br>
    </br>
        2. Scrum Master Helps the team best use Scrum to build the product
    </br>
    </br>
        3. Development team Builds the product
    </br>
    </br>
        These three roles are coequal and all of them have certain responsibilities.</p>

    <h3>Scrum Master</h3>
    <p class="paragrafo2">The Scrum Master helps the product group learn and apply Scrum to achieve business value. The Scrum Master does whatever is in their power to help the Team, Product Owner and organization be successful. The Scrum Master is not the manager of the Team members, nor are they a project manager, team lead, or team representative. Instead, the Scrum Master serves the Team; he or she helps to remove impediments, protects the Team from outside interference, and helps the Team to adopt Agile development practices. He or she educates, coaches and guides the Product Owner, Team and the rest of the organization in the skillful use of Scrum.</p>

    <h3>Scrum Product Owner</h3>
    <p class="paragrafo2">The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing return on investment (ROI) by identifying product features, translating these into a prioritized list, deciding which should be at the top of the list for the next Sprint, and continually re-prioritizing and refining the list. The Product Owner has profit and loss responsibility for the product, assuming it is a commercial product. Product Owner in Agile is like a spokesperson for customer and needs to represent them.</p>

    <p class="paragrafo2">A Development Team is a collection of individuals working together to develop and deliver the requested and committed product increments. It comprises of cross-functional members who are capable of achieving the sprint goals. This could include software engineers, architects, programmers, analysts, system admins, QA experts, testers, UI designers, etc.</p></article>
